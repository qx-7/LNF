# Stardrop

Small flowering bushy plant with purple petals that drip with a sticky psychoactive liquid. Grows well in airy, dark environments, such as on temperate sunless worlds. Its leaves are a waxy bluish green.

The Stardrop is native to the sunless world of <insert here>, where it flourishes under the endless stars. Legend has it that one of the stars themselves once fell to rest on the world, and from its body grew the first Stardrops. 

The psychoactive substance produced by mature Stardrops is often collected and used as a recreational drug, commonly referred to as "starlight" as users frequently experience highly spiritual psychedelic trips through the cosmos. It is believed that the very essence of the stars is distilled into a potent form, as low doses generally produce effects similar to those of long stargazing sessions: a sense of awe, mild vertigo, and a feeling of profundity.

A group of botanists is working on a strain that flourishes deep underground in well-ventilated caverns and caves rich in dimly light-emitting gems. So far, this gemlight strain seems to have much more grounded, focused effects. Its leaves are paler and the plant grows a little taller than typical starlight strains.
