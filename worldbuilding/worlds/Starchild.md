# Starchild

A world awash in endless starlight, warm summer nights, and gentle breezes. The home world of Stardrop flowers. Much of the world is gentle rolling hills carpeted in knee high grass, ever swaying with the rhythmic motion of the air. There is little for non-plant life on the grasslands, but underneath, ancient beings of glittering crystal move at glacial paces through the solid ground. Cavernous chambers and tunnels are left in their wake, walls covered in shed gems. The pale Whitemoss can be found in some caves. Rarely, Stardrops can be found underground, though they do not flower or become as green as their aboveground cousins, tending to stay the same translucent white as very young sprouts well into maturity.

This world is very much attuned to the stars, having been born of the cosmic union of a million million twinkling lovers. Despite having no single sun, the stars look kindly upon it and pay it special preference. The resulting starlight is impossibly brilliant upon those rolling hills, coming from stars closer than they should be. The light has pierced even into the ground, and very slowly, crystals of stellar essence formed deep under the surface, eventually clumping together into colossal crystalline wyrms.
